i need find whether defendant is currently in jail based on sentence details.
the sentence details contains jail duration, (jail can be given as prison or IMPRISONMENT or any other jail synonyms)
jail duration given in years. and if its suspended, it will be given either complete suspended. 
if its partially suspended, it will be given suspended 2 years like that, we need to seperate the suspnded from jail duration.
once jail duration calculated, we need to calculate the date from disposition date. if there is re-sentenced date is given, we need to add the jail duration from resentenced date
if the date is above today date, its reportable.

disposition date = 15-07-2015
sentence details = PROBATION; ; 3 YEARS; FINE; 1905; ; RE SENTENCED; ; ON 05/05/2022; JAIL; ; 5 YEARS
